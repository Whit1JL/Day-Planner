# Day-Planner



This homework assignment tested my knowledge on APIs. We were instructed to create a daily planner that shows the standard business hours of 9 am - 5 pm. There are color coded time blocks to represent the past(gray), the present(red), and the future(green). When you save an item in text area, it remains, even after refreshing the page. This planner will help anyone manage their time more effectively.
